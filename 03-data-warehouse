-- 1. What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?

select count(*) from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust;

-- 2. Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables. What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

select count(distinct PULocationID) from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_ext_2024;

select count(distinct PULocationID) from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust;

-- 3. Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table. Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

select PULocationID from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust;

select PULocationID, DOLocationID from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust;

-- 4. How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

select count(*)
from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust
where fare_amount = 0;

-- 5. What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)

create or replace table my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_part_clust
partition by date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
cluster by vendorid as
select * from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_ext_2024;

Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID

-- 6. Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)
Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?
Choose the answer which most closely matches.

select distinct vendorid
from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_non_part_clust
where tpep_dropoff_datetime between '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';

select distinct vendorid
from my_ds_zoomcamp.yellow_data_2024_part_clust
where tpep_dropoff_datetime between '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';
